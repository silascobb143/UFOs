# UFOs

#Overview 
* The purpose of this analysis was to create Danaâ€™s webpage this dynamic table that are working as intended, while providing a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to being able to add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

#Findings
* When navigating through the site we created it proves to be very easy and to the point when look for the desired info.
* We have even created suggested info for how to filter your search based off of locations, time, and shape.  So if you were wanting to find info on Dallas Texas you could easily do so.
* After making your searches you will be provided a list of desired outputs that best fit your criteria.

#Summary
* A drawback that instantly sticks out is the inability to make multiple selection.  What I mean by this is that we can only select a specific date, or city.  If we wanted to find an entire range of cities and dates we could not do that witht the current layout.
* While there is that drawback an improvement that could be made is allowing for more info and data to be used.  The could mean allowing for other people to add their sightings that way our data can grow.
* Another improvement we could try that would make the webpage more friendly is by adding options to broaden our search.  Just like this is now a drawback we can make this become a strong point by letting the uses select ranges for dates and maybe multiple cities within the searches.  After adding these if we add a simple search button to let the cusotmer know that their desired information has been run properly.
